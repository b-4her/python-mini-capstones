# 60 Days of Python – Project Collection

This repository contains a selection of Python projects I worked on between March and September 2024 while completing the first 60 days of the **"100 Days of Code: Python"** course by Dr. Angela Yu on Udemy.

These projects reflect my personal implementations of the course challenges. I decided to upload a few of them to GitHub to showcase my learning progress and effort during that period.

## 📌 Notes

- All projects were built in Python 3.
- No descriptions are included — each project is self-contained in its own folder.
